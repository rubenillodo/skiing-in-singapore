# Skiing in Singapore

This is a coding challenge
[proposed by RedMart](http://geeks.redmart.com/2015/01/07/skiing-in-singapore-a-coding-diversion/) (you can also read it
[here](PROBLEM.md)).

To run this project, download the repository and execute `yarn` (you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), obviously). After than, you can run `yarn best-path mapTest.txt` to see the output for the
small test matrix explained in the problem's description. You can also run `yarn best-path map.txt` to see the output
for the big matrix provided for the challenge.

If you feel lazy, though, the output is just below these lines.
